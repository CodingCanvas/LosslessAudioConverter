audio convert visual flow:

Loading screen?
	Just a timer/logo?
	
Intro screen for first-timers?
	Tell user what this does, how to use it, and a "don't show again" checkbox?
	Include a settings wizard for...
		- formats to convert (just lossless, lossy, other?)
		- formats to just copy?
		- This would be nice, look impressive, be nice for users, feel familiar.
		
Choose your directories (include a hamburger icon for changing settings
	Show how many files will be converted
	Show how many songs will be copied
	Show how many other files will be copied
	
Scan/analyze progress/results
	How much work will be done?
	Will we reconvert files that already exist?  Skip?
	
Operation progress
	Progress bars (I like #done/#total)
		one for conversion, one for copying
		
Everything's done
	Output results
		Size before, size after (let user know the benefit!)
		Conversion time
		# converted, # copied, #skipped
	'Close' button
	'Start over' button
	'Donate' button
	'Look at my profile' button
