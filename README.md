# Lossless Audio Converter
Easily convert lossless music collections to lossy format.

## What is this for?
Some people prefer storing their music collections in the .FLAC format so that it can be converted into any other format with no unnecessary loss in quality.  Problem is, if you want to convert a large collection into a lossy format -whether it's for streaming, or saving space on your portable devices- you'll be hard-pressed to do it short of writing your own complicated script.

This application provides a simple interface for creating a much smaller, lossy copy of your lossless music collection with just a few clicks.

## Notes
This application currently supports converting .FLAC files into the .ogg format.  Let me know if you'd like it to support any other formats.
